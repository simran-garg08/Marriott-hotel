           <p style="font-size: large;"><i><b><span>Welcome to Hotel Marriott !</span> We are dedicated to providing our guests with an exceptional experience during their stay.
		Marriott is the largest hotel chain in the world by the number of available rooms.<span> It has 31 brands with 8,000 	properties containing 1,423,044 rooms in 139 countries and territories Of these 8,000 properties, 2,149 are operated by 	Marriott, and 5,493 are operated by others pursuant to franchise agreements. </span>The company also operates 20 hotel reservation 	centers.

Marriott International, Inc. was formed in 1993 when Marriott Corporation split into two companies: Marriott International, Inc., which franchises and manages properties, and Host Marriott Corporation (now Host Hotels & Resorts), which owns properties.

Since the <span>founders were Mormon missionaries</span>, copies of the Book of Mormon are provided in hotel rooms in addition to the Bible.</b></i></p><br>

        <section id="history">
            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline; text-align: center;">Our History</h2>
            <p><i><b>Marriott Corporation was founded by <span>John Willard Marriott in 1927</span> when he and his wife, Alice Marriott, opened a root beer stand in Washington, D.C. After serving a Mormon mission in New England, Marriott traveled to Washington, D.C. where he experienced the humid summer weather of the city. Marriott was convinced that what residents of the city needed was a place to get a cool drink, and so after returning to Utah and graduating from The University of Utah, Marriott purchased the rights to franchise an A&W root beer stand in Columbia Heights. The first summer saw brisk business, but as cold weather approached they realized the seasonal nature of their business and received permission from A&W to start selling food. He named the restaurant Hot Shoppes and watched as it grew in popularity. Always looking for new ways to improve his company, he bought the vacant lot next to one of his Hot Shoppes, removed the curb, and began offering the first drive-in service on the East Coast. This move popularized the restaurants, and by 1932, the Marriotts owned 7 Hot Shoppes in the D.C. area. In 1953, Hot Shoppes, Inc. became a public company via an initial public offering.

<span>The company opened its first hotel, the Twin Bridges Motor Hotel, in Arlington, Virginia, on January 16, 1957.</span> It cost $9 per night, plus an extra $1 for every person that was in the car. Its second hotel, the Key Bridge Marriott in Rosslyn, Arlington, Virginia, was opened in 1957 and was Marriott International's longest continuously operating hotel until its closure in July 2021.

<span>Hot Shoppes, Inc. was renamed the Marriott Corporation in 1967.</span>
In 1976, the company opened two theme parks named Marriott's Great America in California and in Illinois. Six Flags acquired the latter in 1984, while Cedar Fair has owned the California park since 2006. Since then, we have been committed to delivering <span>outstanding hospitality and service to our guests.</span></b></i></p><br><br><br>
